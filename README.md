# **Face Mask Detection 😷 | Deep Learning-Based Model**

This project uses **computer vision and deep learning** to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. It can be used for **real-time monitoring** in public places to ensure compliance with mask-wearing guidelines.

## 🚀 **Features**
✅ Real-time face mask detection using OpenCV & Deep Learning  
✅ Trained on a dataset of masked & unmasked faces  
✅ Supports live webcam & image-based detection  
✅ Deployable on web apps or mobile devices  
✅ Model accuracy: **94%**  

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
🔹 Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras  
🔹 NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas  
🔹 ResNet50V2

## 📌 **Usage**
### 1️⃣ Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2️⃣ Run the detection script:
```sh
python detect_mask.py
```
### 3️⃣ Use a webcam or image input for detection.
